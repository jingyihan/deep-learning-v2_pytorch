## Project Overview

This capstone project will investigate dog breed identification and build an algorithm to produce an estimation of a dog breed given a dog image or dog breed that best ensembles the provided human image. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Project Materials

### dog_app.ipynb

The file is cloned from the Udacity repository with commend shown below:
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
		cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-dog-classification
	```
	
	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__

__NOTE:__ In the notebook, you will need to train CNNs in PyTorch.  If your CNN is taking too long to train, feel free to pursue one of the options under the section __Accelerating the Training Process__ below.

## (Optionally) Accelerating the Training Process 

If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen CNN architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU.  If you'd like to use a GPU, you can spin up an instance of your own:

#### Amazon Web Services

You can use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money, but enrolled students should see a coupon code in their student `resources`.)

## Evaluation

Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the CNN project rubric.  Review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission.  All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.


## Project Submission

Your submission should consist of the github link to your repository.  Your repository should contain:
- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name `report.html` or `report.pdf`.

Please do __NOT__ include any of the project data sets provided in the `dogImages/` or `lfw/` folders.
